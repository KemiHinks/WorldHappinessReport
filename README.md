# **QUESTIONS**

1) What was the average happiness score across all countries in 2020?  
2) Determine what percentage of countries were above the average score and what percentage were below in 2020.  
3) Compare the happiness averages and percentages in 2024 against that of 2020.  Which year had the highest average happiness score recorded and which had the lowest?  
4) Compare the happiness averages and percentages across the 5 year period.  Which year had the highest average happiness score recorded and which had the lowest?  
5) Determine the coefficient of correlation between the happiness score and each key variable using the 30 happiest and least happiest countries according to happiness score in 2020 (The year with the lowest average happiness score).    
6) Determine the coefficient of correlation between the happiness score and each key variables using the 30 happiest and least happiest countries in 2022 (The year with the highest average happiness score).   
7) Determine the coefficient of correlation between the happiness score and each key variables using the 30 happiest and least happiest countries over the 5 year period.

5. Among the 30 countries deemed happiest in 2020, there is a positive correlation coefficient between the happiness score and each variable. The strongest positive relationship being with perceptions of corruption followed by social support then freedom to make life choices.

Although social support does serve as an indicator,  strong indicators that remain unmeasured are likely to exist

6. Among the 30 happiest and least happiest countries of 2022 the strongest indicator of happiness is social support. The correlation with all others indicators is weak amongst the unhappiest countries with a nonlinear relationship displayed.

7. The correlation between the indicators and happiness score has weakened for the 30 happiest countries, particularly perceptions of corruption, generosity and GDP Per Capita.

8. Among the 15 countries that experienced the greatest increase in their happiness scores, most were originally ranked in the lower quartile of the global happiness index.

The majority of these countries experienced a rise in GDP Per Capita, increased feeling of freedom and a reduced perception of corruption and a significant decline in generosity and healthy life expectancy.
